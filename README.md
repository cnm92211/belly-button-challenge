# JavaScript Visualization Challenge: Belly Button Biodiversity

*JavaScript Visualization Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 14*

## Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Assignment Components
This repository consists of two main components:

* **Interactive Page (`index.html`):**
This HTML file serves as the interactive page containing the visualizations and data analysis. 

* **JavaScript Visualization Code (`app.js`):**
This JavaScript file contains the code for the interactive elements on the page.
